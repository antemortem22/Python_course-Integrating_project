# Python_course-Integrating_project
Now at March 23rd, 2023 IÂ´m doing a python course where we were asked to do a project with some instructions to follow:
*"A university wants to create a program to keep track of the courses each student is taking.*
*To do this, a console application must first be created that prompts the user for the name *
*of a student and the number of courses they are enrolled in. *
*These two values must be stored as a list of two elements (the name and the number of courses as an integer) in a list of students.*
*Once this is done, the program should prompt the user, upon starting, *
*to choose one of the following two operations: add a student or view the list of entered students."*

Starting from these instructions, I've decided to add one more option and costumixe it a bit. By now, the only way to use this program is by console.
This project has many stages and now we can see how works the first one:
